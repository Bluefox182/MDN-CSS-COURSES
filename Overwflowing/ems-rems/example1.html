    <ul class="ems">
      <li>One</li>
      <li>Two</li>
      <li>
        Three
        <ul>
          <li>Three A</li>
          <li>
            Three B
            <ul>
              <li>Three B 2</li>

      To recap, the em unit means "my parent element's font-size" in the case of
      typography. The li elements inside the ul with a class of ems take their
      sizing from their parent. So each successive level of nesting gets
      progressively larger, as each has its font size set to 1.3em â€” 1.3 times
      its parent's font size.

    <ul class="rems">
      <li>One</li>
      <li>Two</li>
      <li>
        Three
        <ul>
          <li>Three A</li>
          <li>
            Three B
            <ul>
              <li>Three B 2</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To recap, the rem unit means "The root element's font-size". rem stands
      for "root em". The li elements inside the ul with a class of rems take
      their sizing from the root element html. This means that each successive
      level of nesting does not keep getting larger.
